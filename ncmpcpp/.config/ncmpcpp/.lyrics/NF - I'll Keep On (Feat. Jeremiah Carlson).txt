Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on
I'll keep on, I'll keep on, I'll keep on

Faith is something I am not accustomed to
And trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
But really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and You offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there and get wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me?
You said You've always got Your hands out
And I cannot continue on my own so take my hands now
I give You everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin, but I built a house and I still live in it
Afraid to open up the door to You, let You into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is Your direction
I know I told You, "I do not need Your protection"
But I lied to You, this thing is tiring
And man was not created for it
God, please retire me now

Yeah, trust is something I am not accustomed to
And I know the Bible says that I should always trust in You
But, I don't ever read that book enough
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up or pick it up
It collects dust on my night stand
I'm just being honest, please take this out of my hands
I have no control, I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God who's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity You've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hole if You are not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling than when I look in the sky in Your eyes
It's amazing
